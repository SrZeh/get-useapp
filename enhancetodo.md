# üöÄ Get-UseApp - Structure & Nesting Enhancement TODO

## Executive Summary
As a senior Expo 2025 developer reviewing this codebase, I've identified several structural inconsistencies and opportunities for improvement in component nesting, folder organization, and architectural patterns. This document provides actionable enhancement tasks prioritized by impact.

---

## üìä Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ **Strengths**
- Good use of feature-based architecture in `components/features/transactions`
- Proper use of Expo Router groups `(auth)`, `(tabs)`
- AppProviders pattern reduces provider nesting
- Barrel exports (`index.ts`) for cleaner imports
- Platform-specific files (`.native.ts`, `.web.ts`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues Identified**
1. **Dual hook directories** (`/hooks` vs `/src/hooks`) causing confusion
2. **Duplicate hook implementations** (e.g., `useTransactionsDot.ts` in two locations)
3. **Inconsistent feature organization** (some features have dedicated folders, others don't)
4. **Empty/unused folders** (`app/(tabs)/transactions/_components/`)
5. **Provider location inconsistency** (`AuthProvider` in `/src/providers` vs others in `/providers`)
6. **Scattered components** at root level that should be organized
7. **Type duplication** across feature folders and `/types`

---

## üéØ Priority 1: Critical Structural Improvements

### 1.1 Consolidate Hook Directories
**Current Problem:** Hooks exist in both `/hooks` and `/src/hooks`, causing:
- Import confusion
- Duplicate implementations (`useTransactionsDot.ts`)
- Inconsistent patterns

**Actions:**
- [ ] Audit all hooks in `/src/hooks` and move to `/hooks/features/[feature-name]/`
- [ ] Remove duplicate `hooks/useTransactionsDot.ts` (keep `hooks/features/transactions/useTransactionsDot.ts`)
- [ ] Update all imports across the codebase
- [ ] Remove `/src/hooks` directory after migration
- [ ] Update `hooks/index.ts` barrel file to export from feature directories

**Expected Structure:**
```
/hooks
  /features
    /transactions
      - useTransactionsDot.ts
      - useTransactions.ts (moved from /src/hooks)
      - useTransactionActions.ts (moved from /src/hooks)
      - index.ts
    /auth
      - useTermsAccepted.ts (moved from /src/hooks)
    /messages
      - useUnreadMessages.ts (moved from /src/hooks)
      - useUnreadMessagesDot.ts (moved from /src/hooks)
  - useAuth.ts
  - useItemForm.ts
  - index.ts
```

**Files to Update:**
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Update `useTransactionsDot` import
- `components/GlobalTabBar.tsx` - Update hook imports
- All files importing from `/src/hooks`

---

### 1.2 Eliminate Empty/Unused Folders
**Current Problem:** 
- `app/(tabs)/transactions/_components/` exists but is empty
- Git shows deleted files suggest this was recently cleaned but folder remains

**Actions:**
- [ ] Remove `app/(tabs)/transactions/_components/` directory
- [ ] Verify no stale imports referencing this path
- [ ] Document that route-specific components should live in `components/features/[route-name]/` not in route folders

**Rationale:** Expo Router routes should not contain component code - components belong in `/components` with feature-based organization.

---

### 1.3 Consolidate Provider Location
**Current Problem:** `AuthProvider` is in `/src/providers` while others are in `/providers`

**Actions:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Move `src/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` ‚Üí `providers/AuthProvider.tsx`
- [x] Update import in `app/_layout.tsx`: `@/src/providers/AuthProvider` ‚Üí `@/providers/AuthProvider`
- [x] Update import in `providers/AppProviders.tsx`
- [x] Search and update all other imports
- [x] Verify `src/providers` directory can be removed
- [x] Move `src/types/firebase-auth-rn.d.ts` ‚Üí `types/firebase-auth-rn.d.ts`
- [x] Remove entire `/src` directory

**Files to Update:**
- `app/_layout.tsx` (line 22)
- `providers/AppProviders.tsx` (line 23)
- All other files importing from `/src/providers`

---

## üéØ Priority 2: Feature Organization Consistency

### 2.1 Complete Feature-Based Component Organization
**Current Problem:** Only transactions have feature-based structure; other features are scattered

**Actions:**
- [ ] Create `components/features/auth/` and move auth-related components:
  - `AuthHeaderRight.tsx` ‚Üí `components/features/auth/AuthHeaderRight.tsx`
- [ ] Create `components/features/items/` and consolidate:
  - `components/items/*` ‚Üí `components/features/items/`
  - Consider renaming `ItemCard.tsx` ‚Üí `components/features/items/ItemCard.tsx`
- [ ] Create `components/features/profile/` for profile-specific components
- [ ] Create `components/features/chat/` for chat-specific components
- [ ] Ensure each feature folder has `index.ts` barrel export
- [ ] Update main `components/index.ts` to re-export from features

**Target Structure:**
```
/components
  /features
    /auth
      - AuthHeaderRight.tsx
      - index.ts
    /items
      - ItemCard.tsx
      - ItemHeader.tsx
      - ItemManagementCard.tsx
      - index.ts
    /transactions
      - [existing structure]
    /profile
      - ProfileHeader.tsx (if exists)
      - index.ts
    /chat
      - ChatBubble.tsx (if exists)
      - index.ts
  /ui          # Shared UI primitives
  /forms       # Shared form components
  /layouts     # Layout components
```

---

### 2.2 Route Component Organization
**Current Problem:** Route-specific logic mixed into route files instead of components

**Actions:**
- [ ] Extract complex logic from `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` into:
  - `components/features/transactions/TransactionsTabs.tsx` (tab switcher UI)
  - `components/features/transactions/TransactionsTabIndicator.tsx` (sliding pill)
- [ ] Consider extracting route-specific components for:
  - `app/item/new.tsx` ‚Üí `components/features/items/ItemCreateForm.tsx`
  - `app/item/[id]/edit/[id].tsx` ‚Üí `components/features/items/ItemEditForm.tsx`
- [ ] Keep routes thin - only routing logic, delegate to components

**Principle:** Routes should be thin wrappers that compose feature components.

---

### 2.3 Type Consolidation Strategy
**Current Problem:** Types duplicated between `/types` and feature folders

**Actions:**
- [ ] Establish rule: Feature-specific types live in `/types/[feature].ts`, feature folders only re-export
- [ ] Remove duplicate type definitions in:
  - `components/features/transactions/types.ts` (already re-exports, good!)
  - `hooks/features/transactions/types.ts` (already re-exports, good!)
- [ ] Audit `/types` directory for missing feature types
- [ ] Document type organization pattern in `.cursorrules`

**Pattern:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Feature types in /types
// /types/reservation.ts
export type ReservationStatus = 'requested' | 'accepted' | ...;

// ‚úÖ Good: Feature folders re-export
// /components/features/transactions/types.ts
export type * from '@/types/reservation';

// ‚ùå Bad: Duplicate type definitions in feature folders
```

---

## üéØ Priority 3: Route Structure Enhancements

### 3.1 Improve Transaction Route Grouping
**Current Problem:** Transaction routes are flat; could use route groups for better organization

**Actions:**
- [ ] Consider restructuring `app/transaction/` to use route groups:
```
/app
  /transaction
    /(manage)        # Owner actions
      /[id]
        /accept.tsx
        /reject.tsx
    /(request)       # Renter actions
      /request/[itemId].tsx
      /[id]
        /chat.tsx
        /pay.tsx
        /return.tsx
```
- [ ] **Alternative:** Keep current structure but document routing patterns
- [ ] Ensure route groups don't break navigation patterns

**Note:** Route groups are optional but can improve organization for complex flows. Evaluate based on navigation complexity.

---

### 3.2 Standardize Route Layout Files
**Current Problem:** Inconsistent use of layout files

**Actions:**
- [ ] Add `app/item/_layout.tsx` if item routes share common behavior
- [ ] Add `app/profile/_layout.tsx` if profile routes share common behavior
- [ ] Document when to use route layouts vs component composition
- [ ] Consider `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` improvements (already exists, good!)

---

## üéØ Priority 4: Service Layer Organization

### 4.1 Service Directory Structure Review
**Current State:** Services are well-organized with interfaces and implementations

**Potential Enhancements:**
- [ ] Consider `services/features/` pattern for feature-specific services:
```
/services
  /features
    /items
      - ItemService.ts
      - ItemReader.ts
      - ItemWriter.ts
    /reservations
      - ReservationService.ts
      - ReservationRules.ts
    /reviews
      - ReviewService.ts
  /interfaces
  /implementations
```
- [ ] **Alternative:** Keep current structure (it's already good with interfaces/implementations pattern)

**Note:** Current service structure is solid. Only refactor if it improves discoverability.

---

## üéØ Priority 5: Import Path Optimization

### 5.1 Barrel Export Completeness
**Actions:**
- [ ] Ensure all feature folders have `index.ts` barrel exports
- [ ] Verify `components/index.ts` re-exports all features
- [ ] Verify `hooks/index.ts` re-exports all feature hooks
- [ ] Consider `services/index.ts` barrel export (if not exists)
- [ ] Update `.cursorrules` with barrel export standards

**Pattern:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Feature barrel export
// components/features/transactions/index.ts
export { OwnerInbox } from './OwnerInbox';
export { MyReservations } from './MyReservations';
export type * from './types';

// ‚úÖ Good: Root barrel re-exports
// components/index.ts
export * from './features/transactions';
```

---

### 5.2 Absolute Import Consistency
**Current State:** Using `@/` prefix - good!

**Actions:**
- [ ] Audit for any relative imports (`../`) that should be absolute
- [ ] Ensure all imports use `@/` prefix consistently
- [ ] Document import path conventions

---

## üéØ Priority 6: Component Nesting Depth Reduction

### 6.1 Flatten Deep Component Structures
**Current Problem:** Some nested action components could be flatter

**Actions:**
- [ ] Review `components/features/transactions/owner-actions/` structure:
  - Consider flattening if depth > 3: `owner-actions/AcceptedActions.tsx` could be `owner-actions/AcceptedActions.tsx`
  - Current structure is acceptable if each action is complex
- [ ] Review `components/features/transactions/renter-actions/` similarly
- [ ] Ensure no component folder exceeds 3 levels deep (per cursor rules)

**Rule:** Max 3 levels of nesting per project standards.

---

### 6.2 Extract Complex Nested Logic
**Actions:**
- [ ] Review `app/_layout.tsx` - platform-specific rendering could use composition
- [ ] Consider extracting `AppContent` to `components/layouts/AppContent.tsx`
- [ ] Consider platform-specific layout components (already exists in `app/_layouts/` - good!)
- [ ] Ensure no single component exceeds 200 lines (per cursor rules)

---

## üéØ Priority 7: Type Safety & Organization

### 7.1 Type Definition Audit
**Actions:**
- [ ] Ensure all exported types are in `/types` directory
- [ ] Remove any inline complex types from components (extract to `/types`)
- [ ] Document when types belong in feature folders vs `/types`:
  - **Shared types** ‚Üí `/types`
  - **Feature-specific types** ‚Üí `/types/[feature].ts`
  - **Re-export in features** for convenience

---

## üéØ Priority 8: Documentation & Standards

### 8.1 Update Cursor Rules
**Actions:**
- [ ] Document feature-based folder structure pattern
- [ ] Document hook organization: `/hooks/features/[feature-name]/`
- [ ] Document component organization: `/components/features/[feature-name]/`
- [ ] Document type organization strategy
- [ ] Add examples of proper nesting (max 3 levels)
- [ ] Add route organization guidelines

---

### 8.2 Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
**Consider creating ADRs for:**
- [ ] Feature-based folder structure decision
- [ ] Hook consolidation strategy
- [ ] Route grouping patterns
- [ ] Component nesting depth limits

## üìù Notes for AI Prompts

When asking AI to help with these enhancements, use prompts like:

### For Hook Consolidation:
```
"Consolidate all hooks from /src/hooks into /hooks/features/[feature-name]/ 
following the transactions feature pattern. Remove duplicates and update all imports."
```

### For Feature Organization:
```
"Reorganize components to follow feature-based structure. Move auth components to 
components/features/auth/, items to components/features/items/, etc. Create 
barrel exports for each feature."
```

### For Route Extraction:
```
"Extract complex logic from app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx into reusable components 
in components/features/transactions/. Keep the route file thin."
```

---

## üéì Best Practices to Maintain

1. **Feature-First Organization**: Group by feature, not by type
2. **Barrel Exports**: Always create index.ts for public APIs
3. **Max 3 Levels**: Never exceed 3 levels of folder nesting
4. **Thin Routes**: Routes should only handle routing, delegate to components
5. **Shared Types**: Keep types in /types, re-export in features
6. **Consistent Naming**: Use feature names consistently across components/hooks/services

---

## üö® Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ‚ùå Don't put components inside route folders (`app/route/_components/`)
- ‚ùå Don't duplicate hooks in multiple locations
- ‚ùå Don't mix `/src` and root-level directories for same purpose
- ‚ùå Don't create deep nesting (>3 levels)
- ‚ùå Don't duplicate type definitions
- ‚ùå Don't use relative imports when absolute available
